- [x] Thoughts on Skinning and LDS: https://turanszkij.wordpress.com/2018/02/03/thoughts-on-skinning-and-lds/
    - Put all bones information into LDS before triggering skinning shader instances
    - Interesting explanation about CU x shader x threads
- [x] Breaking down barriers: https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2018/03/06/breaking-down-barriers-part-1-whats-a-barrier/
    - Good barrieer concept vulgarization i.e. real life -> cpu -> gpu
    - Barriers are not only about synchronizing thread of executions (Draw Call A must be finish before B starts) but also data flow i.e. cache flush, RT internal compression, etc.
    - Since it is very HW specific D3D12 and Vulkan have chosen to use the concept of resource states which implicitely synchronize threads and data (cache, etc.)
