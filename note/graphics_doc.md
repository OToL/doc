- [x] Thoughts on Skinning and LDS: https://turanszkij.wordpress.com/2018/02/03/thoughts-on-skinning-and-lds/
    - Put all bones information into LDS before triggering skinning shader instances
    - Interesting explanation about CU x shader x threads
- [x] Breaking down barriers
    - Part 1: https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2018/03/06/breaking-down-barriers-part-1-whats-a-barrier/
        - Good barrieer concept vulgarization i.e. real life -> cpu -> gpu
        - Barriers are not only about synchronizing thread of executions (Draw Call A must be finish before B starts) but also data flow i.e. cache flush, RT internal compression, etc.
        - Since it is very HW specific D3D12 and Vulkan have chosen to use the concept of resource states which implicitely synchronize threads and data (cache, etc.)
    - Part 2: https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2018/04/01/breaking-down-barriers-part-2-synchronizing-gpu-threads/
        - Barriers are reducing core(s) occupancy because the dispatches are not executed in parallel and the one in progress may no use all cores: "the performance cost of a flush is directly tied to the decrease in utilization"
        - We can improve core occupancy by interleaving dependent dispatches with independent ones
        - FLUSH command granularity is coarse i.e. it waiting for all previously issued dispatch to be finished
        - We can have much finer grain control with Labels
- [X] Octahedral Impostors: http://shaderbits.com/blog/octahedral-impostors
    - Very nice tree imposters technique based on multiple baked views around the model using a octahedral
    - Octahedral is better than a spehere because the vertices repartition is uniform
    - A half-octahedral is often sufficient because we don't care about object's bottom
    - This article also explain cheaper and less accurate techniques such as simple card boards with parallax

    - Basic approach but interesting for people who does not know about it
