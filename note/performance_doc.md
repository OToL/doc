  - Flame graph seems useful and supported by many profilers as data post process
  - Good online tool to do micro benchmark: http://quick-bench.com/
  - When benchmarking code (multiple execution) do not always consider min/max/average execution time but also the variance/deviation

  - It is important to choose the good profiling metrics (e.g. number of dropped frames) i.e. What do I have to optimize? and How to measure it reliably?
  - Both micro (only the problematic code is executed) and synthetic (re-create artificially game conditions) benchmarks are important
  - Maximize the reproduceability of the issue e.g. if the issue occurs when spawning an entity, we should try doing it every frame
  - Always measure every single progress i.e. for each optimization, measure and document the relative improvement (keep all traces, graphs, etc.)
  - Find a graphical way to express your improvements in order to easily communicate them
